# Sidetracked - A Todo Application

Sidetracked is a fully-featured todo application developed in Rust, demonstrating the use of modern software architecture principles including Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture. This project utilizes a range of technologies such as Axum for the backend, HTMX for a no/low JavaScript frontend, and DaisyUI for styling.

This project is a work in progress, and is the result of a series of articles I am writing. You can find them on my site at [elidhu.com](https://elidhu.com/tags/sidetracked/).
